Thank you for downloading our Toon Pony Kit!
------------------------------------------------------


This kit contains a lovingly designed horse (about 10K verts) which can be created as a unicorn, a crowned pony, a normal horse, and flying types of them. 
6 types and 15 character variants are already prepared as prefabs, and with the help of more than 50 textures and materials you can still create numerous of them yourself, by assigning the prepared materials to the intended mesh. 

=> 12 different Cutie Marks can be assigned to the Pony´s rear side. 
=> Besides a cool Eye Wink Script puts more life in your pony´s face. 

There are 14 animations included: 

- Bow
- Ears
- Breathe
- Fly
- FlyJump
- Graze
- HeadDown
- HeadLeftTurn
- HeadRightTurn
- RearingUp
- Run
- Walk
- SniffingAir
- Tail 

-----------------

Change colors for building your own Pony:

1. Choose one the prepared prefabs and drag it into the scene
2. Unfold "PonyMeshes" in the prefab
3. Drag your favorite materials onto the intended meshes
4. Grab the prefab now from the scene and drag into the prefabs-folder => voilà your new pony-prefab!

-----------------

Informations about the Eye Wink Script:

The script is already added as a component on your pony-prefabs. 
The mesh "PonyEyes" is chosen as renderer (can be assigned by drag and drop or by clicking on the small circle on the right). You can define a close eye time, an open eye time and an open eye time delta. The pony´s closed eye - texture, which is defined in the last line, changes with the open eye - texture.
